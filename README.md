# volumential-tables
Pre-built tables that can be used with [volumential](https://gitlab.tiker.net/xywei/volumential).

The goal of this repository is to provide precomputation results for various kernels using `volumential`
that can be immediately used for volume potential evaluations.

To download the tables, visit the [release](https://github.com/xywei/volumential-tables/releases) page.

The tables are provided in `hdf5` format. The contents can be inspected easily with [hdfview](https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdfview/).
